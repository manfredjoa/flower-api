# ðŸŒ» Plants API ðŸŒ»

## Introduction

Welcome to my Plants API! I wanted to challenge myself for this project by creating my very own API, which in order from less specific to more specific classifications, contains 10 plant families, 26 plant genera, and 112 plant species.

Within this API, each of the species belong to a genus, which belongs to a family. For example, you cannot find a plant species whose genus or family is not contained within the API. The species Pachystachys coccinea belongs to the genus of Pachystachys, which belongs to the Acanthaceae family.

### How to Use

Please refer to the CRUD Functionality section to see more specific endpoints.

To see all families:

```

To see all species:

## Data Model

The database for this project is built using MongoDB and Mongoose, and contains three collections: "families", "genuses", and "species". "Genuses" is the less professional version of the scientific term "genera", which are both plural for genus, but I decided to use genuses as the name of the collection due to MongoDB pluralizing collection names. You can consider "genuses" and "genera" interchangeable within this API.
