# ðŸŒ» Plants API ðŸŒ»

## Introduction

Welcome to my Plants API! I wanted to challenge myself for this project by creating my very own API, which in order from less specific to more specific classifications, contains 10 plant families, 26 plant genera, and 112 plant species.

Within this API, each of the species belong to a genus, which belongs to a family. For example the following photos of data show that you cannot find a plant species whose genus or family is not contained within the API.

<br>

![](<Family data.png>)
This shows that the species Pachystachys coccinea belongs to the Pachystachys genus.

---

<br>

![](<Genus data.png>)
This shows that the Pachystachys genus belongs to the Acanthaceae family and contains the species Pachystachys coccinea.

---

<br>

![](<Species data.png>)
This shows that the Acanthaceae family contains the Pachystachys genus.

### How to Use

**_Please refer to the CRUD Functionality section to see more specific endpoints._**

It will help to have a browser extension such as [JSONVue](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) to parse the data into a more readable json format.

To see all families:

```

To see all genera:

```

```

To see all species:

```

## Data Model

The database for this project is built using MongoDB and Mongoose, and contains three collections: "families", "genuses", and "species". "Genuses" is the less professional version of the scientific term "genera", which are both plural for genus, but I decided to use genuses as the name of the collection due to MongoDB pluralizing collection names. You can consider "genuses" and "genera" interchangeable within this API.

## Installation

If you would like to use this API for your own project:

- Clone this repository
- Initialize npm in your terminal

```
npm init -y
```

- Seed data to locally create the plants database

```
npm run seed
```

- Start server

```
npm start
```

- To start server in development mode, use this instead

```
npm run dev
```

- The API can then be accessed using the following base url in combination with an endpoint

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Next Steps

- Pagination
- Creating a function where when a species or genus is created, its name is also pushed into its parent's array that lists its genera or species. For example, if species Pachystachys somename is created, the data showing the Pachystachys genus will include Pachystachys somename in its array of species. If genus somegenus is created and belongs to the Acanthaceae family, the data showing the Acanthaceae family will include somegenus in its array of genera.
- Creating a function where you don't have to worry about case sensitivity for the whole entire word, not just the first letter. This is especially important for the species get request by common name, in which there is variance in the capitalization of the strings, whereas the family, genus, and species names are all consistent in that the first letter is capitalized. I am aware however, that this can all be avoided by just having the common name data seeded in a consistent format.

## Thoughts

I loved that I was able to take this project as an opportunity to build my own API and create data with a model nested within a model, nested within another model.

Being able to create a function to allow the user to not worry about capitalizing the first letter when searching by the family, genus, or species name was very satisfying. I will be working on extending this functionality to searching by the species' common name.

I ran into an issue in which when I did not pass a parameter or incorrectly passed a parameter, an empty array would be returned instead of an error message. For example, when using endpoint /api/species/common-name/:commonName to get a species by its common name, typing in /api/species/common-name/ or /api/species/common-name/abc would both return [].

I spent a lot of time in my console using logs to figure out how to fix this, and I ended up changing the order of my conditionals to first check if the length of the json object being returned was 0, which would be the result of the parameter being passed not equaling any value being searched for in the mongoose find criteria. If the length equaled 0, it would return the error stating that the family/genus/species was not found. Else, it would continue responding with what they were requesting.

This fixed the issue with typing in an incorrect parameter, but using /api/species/common-name/ as the endpoint was still returning an empty array. To fix this, I created a new controller function for that specific route, in which it would return an error specifying to enter a parameter. It was not this easy however, because it would not work at first, until I figured out I had to move this route to the top of the list even though this url endpoint should not have been caught by any other route preceeding it. Sometimes it's as simple as moving something up in your code, which both of these issues involved!

I'm grateful that finding solutions to these issues became learning experiences, and that these will be easy fixes in the future!
